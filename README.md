# CS50-Final-Project
My Crypto Trading Platform Final Project for CS50

The project goal is to create a website that allows users to buy and sell crypto assests utilizing live charting views from TradingView.com, and API calls for buy and sell pricing from IEX. 

Once users are registered and logged in they will be brought to a screen that shows the current market cap performance of cryptocurrencies for that day. 

From the home screen they will be able to select a number of different cryptocurrencies that will redirect them to pages specifically for those currencies.

Once on a specific page users will see a live chart graphing the current price and trend of that assest. Along with the option to buy and sell that assest.

## Additional Features
A history page will log all of their previous buys and sells.
A cash tab will allow them to add extra cash to their portfolio
